# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Details

## Inspiration üí°
Inspired by our personal connections to dyslexia, having family members who face its challenges, we built a Chrome extension that changes fonts on webpages to dyslexic-friendly ones. This project stems from our desire to make online content more accessible for individuals who can benefit from improved readability. By creating this tool, we hope to contribute to a more inclusive web experience, making it easier for those with dyslexia to access information and navigate the digital world with confidence.

## What it does üîç
Easy-Reader provides a more inclusive web-browsing experience for individuals who face struggles in reading due to dyslexia. By allowing users to change the font on any webpage to ones curated to assist dyslexic reading, Easy-Reader fosters a more inclusive digital environment. Currently, we support arial, cursive, verdana, tahoma, and open sans. 

## How we built it ü¶æ
**Brainstorming&Planning:** We started by outlining the project requirements, features, and data structure for the MVP. This helped in creating a roadmap for development and split the team into distinct roles: two people on the backend and and front end while out third member was working on the design and final presentation.
**Development:** We implemented the project using Javascript, React.js and the Chrome API to inject our curated fonts in the css style sheet of webpages. The front end was built with HTML, CSS, and the React framework and focused specifically on simplicity and overal UI / UX.  
**Integration&Testing:** Rigorous testing was performed to identify and resolve bugs. 

## Challenges we ran into üß†
One of the biggest struggles we encountered was navigating the Chrome API, as we were unfamiliar with many of its features. In addition, we also had trouble understanding how to properly interact with browser functions, manage permissions, and handle background scripts which required significant trial and error. Moreover, learning React for the first time added another layer of complexity. Integrating React with the Chrome extension posed challenges, particularly in managing the state and ensuring seamless communication between components and the extension's background processes. However, with persistent research, hands-on experimentation, and help from the mentors, we gradually became more proficient, ultimately leading to a functional and polished extension.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of üåü
* Learning the React framework from scratch, and implementing it through trial and error
* Learning to use Figma
* Successfully integrating the chrome API to add functionality to our project
* Designing a front-end that adheres to our UI / UX goals
## What we learned ‚úçÔ∏è
Building a functional MVP is better than coming up with a perfectly-designed, overly ambitious project that doesn't work!

## What's next for Easy-Reader ‚ùì
* Adding cross-browser support
* Implement AI to intelligently identify and adjust specific sections of a webpage to optimize readability
* Introduce a feature that lets users create profiles and save their preferences in the cloud
* Translate the extension into multiple languages and adapt it for various cultural contexts
